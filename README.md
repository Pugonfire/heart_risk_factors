# heart_risk_factors

### About

This is a mini project for CZ1115 (Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). We will be using a heart disease dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) to find the important factors used to predict the presence of heart disease in an individual

---

### Problem Definition
* Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death
* Early detection and targeted treatment is key to alleviating the adverse impact of heart disease on people, physically and financially
* By identifying important factors used to predict the presence of heart disease using data and analytics, these factors can then be passed on to researchers for further analysis with the proper domain knowledge

***Note: Correlation does not imply causation. We cannot conclude that the important variables found from our anlysis of data causes heart disease without applying medical domain knowledge***

### Models Used

1. CART
2. Random Forest

---

### Conclusion

The top indicators are as follows:
1. **Thalassemia:** An inherited blood disorder that causes an individual's blood to have less haemoglobin than normal
2. **No. of major vessels (0-3) coloured by fluoroscopy:** 
3. **Maximum heart rate achieved:**

### New Learning Points

* CART Pruning the optimal tree using cp
* Random Forest
* Getting variable importance
